tosca notes

os version should not be an integer


library notes


- definition references interfaces by name in node, but by type in relation.
- a couple of typos
- capability matches node_type by bad name (should be types.nodes.Root)


questions

 - how does inheritance work across types, what inherits (properties, lifecycle)
 - spelling of endpoint vs database endpoint.
 - delete lifecycle operation [ is it normative, may have to combine with deletion]
 - mapping lifecycle to machine operations.. is start automatically re-invoked on boot?
 - is stopped launched before reboot?
 - order of relation lifecycle events

 - the xml policy notion

Binding to variables
